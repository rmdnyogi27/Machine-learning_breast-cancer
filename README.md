# Breast Cancer clasification

##  Breast Cancer clasification USING DECISION TREE
in this project I use Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) Classification Dataset from skicit-learn, this project is to diagnose the type of malignant breast tumor 0 (dangerous) or benign 1 (not dangerous) using the Decision Tree model. there are The number of samples in this dataset is 569 and 31 columns.

## Project Overview :
This data consists of 569 samples with 30 numerical features that contain characteristics of tumor tissue mass, such as size, circumference, texture, and neatness of tumor cell edges. The target labels in this data set are malignant and benign.

## Project Goals :
1. Understanding the dataset Conduct data exploration to understand the available features and target distribution.
2. Evaluating model performance, measuring the accuracy and effectiveness of the model in detecting breast cancer.
3. Data pre-processing, Cleaning and preparing data so that it is ready for use in machine learning models.
4. Create visualization of results, display various graphs and matrices to make it easier to interpret prediction results.

## Conclution
In this project, we succeeded in building a machine learning model to detect breast cancer based on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The model can classify tumors as benign or malignant with a fairly good level of accuracy. This project shows that machine learning has great potential in helping early detection of breast cancer. Implementing a similar model in the medical world can speed up the diagnosis process and help doctors make more accurate decisions.
